# Schema Builder

This is a project that's a small experiment on the feasibility of having an inline schema builder that might
plug into a WYSIWYG editor to allow for named entity definitions within chunks of otherwise unstructured text.

Basically, the use case is to provide linked data connections embedded within things like blog posts or news 
articles.
